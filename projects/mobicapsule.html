                <div class="project-detail-description">
                    <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic ravaged the world, I recognized the need for safer and more efficient methods of transporting infected patients to medical facilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's when I had the idea to transform a car roof box into a transport capsule that could carry one patient at a time. Equipped with an oxygen supply and a ventilation system to prevent the spread of the virus, this rooftop capsule is designed to fit on top of a car and can be easily disinfected after each use.</p>
                    
                    <div class="project-detail-image">
                        <img src="../assets/img/1682073653191.png.webp" alt="Mobicapsule">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Although the capsule has not yet been tested on actual patients and requires approval from health authorities, I am proud to have developed a potential solution to help transport COVID-19 patients in areas with limited access to medical transport. This invention showcases my creativity, problem-solving skills, and dedication to making a positive impact on society during times of crisis.</p>
                    
                    <h3>National Media Coverage</h3>
                    <p>National media outlets have covered my invention and prototype, and I'm grateful for the attention and support.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Industry Support</h3>
                    <p>In addition, I'm proud to have motivated several companies in the industry to join the project, including Norauto, Somfy, and other partners who contributed to testing and development.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Technical Features</h3>
                    <p>The Mobicapsule has been accessorized inside the roof box with a mattress to ensure patient comfort and gloves integrated into the box to allow intervention at any time. The prototype is resistant to high and low temperatures, lightweight and has waterproof qualities.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Mobicapsule also features hermetic holes on the sides for easy access to the patient, as well as outlets for medical equipment, such as respirators, cables, infusion bags, oxygen bottles, and more.</p>
